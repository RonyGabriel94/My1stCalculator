A console app created on Visual Studio 2022 using C#. 
Once you make it start working, it will ask you to add two whole numbers; if you add any decimals, it will take just the whole number part. 
Once you do that, the console app will automatically add, subtract, multiply, and divide the total of those numbers. 
In this case, the result was going to be a decimal, but it will only show the whole part.
